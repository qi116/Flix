### Notes
When using brew, the default download folder is usr/local/bin as opposed to the given /opt... This caused a lot of confusion on my part as I couldn't figure out which commands to run. I ended up reinstalling homebrew in the provided listed opt folder, only to find that this wouldn't allow me to install cocoapods correctly. For future situations, use the brew doctor command to quickly understand what is wrong. I only did this after running a lot of unnecessary commands.

Another thing is that after using the pod install and running the new application, my app wouldn't build as it said that AlamofireImage wasn't a package. To resolve this, I had to click on PodFile and check the "Target Membership" for the AlamofireImage. It seemed to work after this.
